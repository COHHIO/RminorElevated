## Overview

RminorElevated is a Shiny application that provides HMIS data quality monitoring and reporting tools for the Ohio Balance of State Continuum of Care (CoC) and the Mahoning County CoC. The application helps HMIS users verify that their data is accurate and complete through interactive reports and visualizations.

**Note:** This application displays client-level data (without Personally Identifying Information) and requires authentication for access.

## Key Features

RminorElevated includes several reporting modules:

- **Data Quality Reports** - Monitor and identify data completeness and accuracy issues
- **Prioritization Lists** - View and manage client prioritization for housing placement
- **Agency & Program Lookup** - Search and reference agency and program information
- Additional specialized reports for HMIS data analysis including performance reporting, bed & unit counts, and veteran reporting 

## Installation

### For Developers

RminorElevated is not available on CRAN. To install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("COHHIO/RminorElevated")
```

### Prerequisites

This package depends on several internal COHHIO packages that handle data processing:

- `HMISdata` - Data retrieval from AWS
- `HMISprep` - Data preparation and cleaning  
- `HMISserve` - Data serving utilities

These packages must be installed and configured before RminorElevated will function properly.

## Usage

### Accessing the Application

The production application is deployed at the [RminorElevated website](https://ohiobalanceofstatecoc.shinyapps.io/Rminor_elevated/) and requires login credentials. Contact your HMIS administrator for access.

### Running Locally (for development)

```r
library(RminorElevated)

# Ensure you have proper AWS credentials configured
# and that the daily data pipeline has run

# Run the application
shiny::runApp()
```

## Data Pipeline

RminorElevated relies on a daily automated data pipeline that:

1. Retrieves HMIS CSV exports from AWS
2. Pulls supplementary data from Looker via AWS
3. Processes and prepares data using `HMISdata`, `HMISprep`, and `HMISserve`
4. Stores processed data in AWS S3

The application always displays the most recently processed data from this pipeline.

## Target Users

This application is designed for:

- HMIS end users (case managers, housing navigators, program staff)
- Agency administrators
- CoC-level data analysts and coordinators
- Data quality managers

Users should have familiarity with HMIS data standards and their organization's data entry workflows.

## Package Ecosystem

RminorElevated is part of COHHIO's suite of HMIS tools:

```
HMISdata ──→ HMISprep ──→ HMISserve ──→ RminorElevated
   ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓
(Extract)   (Transform)   (Serve)      (Visualize)
```

This modular approach separates data pipeline concerns from the presentation layer, making each component easier to maintain and test.

## For COHHIO Staff

### Deployment

The application is deployed to shinyapps.io. Deployment is managed through:

```r
# Deploy to shinyapps.io
rsconnect::deployApp()
```

### Configuration

Key configuration files:
- AWS credentials and region settings
- Shinyapps.io account configuration  
- Authentication provider settings

See the `aws/` directory for deployment-related configuration.
